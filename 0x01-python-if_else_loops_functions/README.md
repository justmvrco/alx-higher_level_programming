	- the number, followed by
	- the string ``` is ```, followed by the last digit of ``` number ```, followed by
		- ``` and is greter than 5 ``` if the last digit is greater than 5
		- ``` and is 0 ``` if the last digit is 0
		- ``` and is less than 6 and not 0 ``` if the last digit is less than 6 and not 0.
- followed by a new line.
